                Here at Atlantis we focus mainly on the conservation of turtle population and their habitats,
                including coastal ares as well as marshlands.
                Through our website, we aim to educate people about the challenges turtles face and the actions we can take to protect them. 
                By increasing awareness about the plight of turtles, 
                we hope to inspire individuals, communities, and policymakers to take meaningful steps towards conservation.

            <div class="text">
                Turtles, ancient creatures that have roamed the Earth for millions of years, 
                face numerous threats today. Habitat loss, pollution, climate change, 
                and illegal trade pose significant challenges to their survival. According to recent studies, 
                approximately 61% of all turtle species are threatened with extinction, making them one of the most vulnerable groups of vertebrates.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                Nesting beaches, crucial for the continuation of turtle populations, 
                are disappearing at an alarming rate due to coastal development and erosion. 
                Pollution, particularly plastic waste, poses a grave danger to turtles, with an estimated 52% of 
                turtles worldwide having ingested plastic debris. Climate change exacerbates these threats by 
                altering nesting habitats and sea temperatures, affecting the sex ratio of hatchlings and disrupting migration patterns.
